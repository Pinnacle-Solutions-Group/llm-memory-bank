## üõ†Ô∏è Tool Reference

## üìã Key Concepts

### Frontmatter Requirements
- **All fields always present**: Never omit fields, show empty as `field:`
- **Editor-specific formats**: Each editor has different required fields
- **Automatic transformations**: Tool handles conversions between formats

### Rule Categories
- **Core Meta Rules**: AI behavior and FOCUS workflow
- **Workflow Rules**: Planning, implementation, debugging processes  
- **Best Practices**: Coding standards and quality guidelines
- **Project-Specific**: Customized rules for specific codebases

### Transformation Process
1. **Template ‚Üí Editor**: Converts unified format to editor-specific format
2. **Link Rewriting**: Updates internal links for each editor
3. **Field Mapping**: Ensures all required fields are present
4. **Validation**: Checks format compliance and data integrity

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to documentation:

1. **Keep it current**: Update docs when implementing new features
2. **Be specific**: Include exact code examples and error messages
3. **Test examples**: Verify all code snippets work as documented
4. **Cross-reference**: Link between related documentation sections

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers & Maintainers

**Implementation Details:**
- [Frontmatter Structure](frontmatter-structure.md) - Complete YAML frontmatter specifications
- Cross-editor field derivation and preservation logic
- **Automated Quality Assurance**: markdownlint runs automatically after `project-to-rules`
- Comprehensive test suite (38 tests) covering all transformations

**Development Workflow:**
1. Make changes in editor-specific project files
2. Run `project-to-rules` to sync back to template
3. Automatic markdownlint fixes formatting issues
4. Commit unified template changes
5. Use `rules-to-project` to deploy to other projects
