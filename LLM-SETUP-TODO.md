# Required Setup for the LLM Memory Bank

## ðŸ§  Memory Bank: What to Update First

Update these files to reflect your project:

- [ ] `memory-bank/project/project_brief.md` â€” Project overview, objectives, users, timeline, metrics
- [ ] `memory-bank/project/product_context.md` â€” Problem, solution, value, market, competitive advantage
- [ ] `memory-bank/project/architecture.md` â€” System architecture (add if missing)
- [ ] `memory-bank/project/system_patterns.md` â€” Design patterns, data flow, security (add if missing)
- [ ] `memory-bank/project/tech_context.md` â€” Tech stack, integrations, deployment (add if missing)
- [ ] `memory-bank/project/directory_structure.md` â€” Source code layout
- [ ] `memory-bank/status/project_status.md` â€” Current progress, tasks, milestones, blockers
- [ ] `memory-bank/reference/troubleshooting_log.md` â€” Error log (add if missing)
- [ ] `memory-bank/reference/user_docs/` â€” End-user guides (optional)
- [ ] `memory-bank/reference/release_docs/` â€” Release notes (optional)

## NOTE: Utilize the LLM to assist with this

Here is a real-world example of starting the architecture:

> My plan for this is to use @tech_context.md and build the @project_brief.md
> Users will be able to take photos of receipts from their phone, and their receipts should be uploaded to:
> [bucket]/receipts/[user-email]/[yyyy-mm-dd]/[guid].png
> using amplify.  It will then be submitted to OpenAI for recognition and categorization and entered into the DynamoDB database
> Then, when complete, the user can flag the expense report to be approved and download an excel copy
