# Rules for LLM-Assisted Development

This directory contains rules and guidelines to help the LLM (you) effectively assist in the development of the expense report application.

## Categories

- **`core/`**: Fundamental rules that should generally always be active. These cover basic interaction, how to use the memory bank, and core project tenets.
- **`best-practices/`**: Guidelines derived from experience and common pitfalls. These help in producing higher quality code and avoiding rework.
- **`workflow/`**: Rules tailored to specific phases of development:
  - `planning/`: For when we are defining scope, features, and architecture.
  - `implementation/`: For when we are actively writing code.
  - `debugging/`: For when we are identifying and fixing issues.

Consult the `README.md` within each subdirectory for a description of the rules it contains.
